# " Exudates are echogenic in one third of cases. Pleural thickening, nodular changes in the pleura, septa, and the formation of cavities only occur in cases of pleural exudates"
15108850v1 Praxis 93(15):615-21,2004 "[Thoraxsonography--Part 1: Chest wall and pleura]." The detection of lymph nodes and a careful interpre
tation of dignity is one of the main indications for chest wall sonography. Palpable unclear masses of the chest wall can undergo US guided p
uctures very easily. Either rib and sternum fractures are detectable very sensitively. In addition to the more sensitive detection than in normal X-ray also accompanying soft parts processes, pleural effusions and haematomas can be visualised. Despite the physical laws of ultrasound, approximately 70% of the pleural surface can be accessed by sonography. The normal parietal pleural can be visualized and delineated from circumscribed as well as diffuse pathological thickening. The normal visceral pleura is hidden by the total reflection at the surface of the aerated lung. Sonographic evidence of a pleural effusion can be obtained from 5 ml onwards and is much more sensitive than a chest X-ray, especially in supine position; false positive findings are not encountered. A more accurate estimation of the quantity of effusion can be made. Exudates are echogenic in one third of cases. Pleural thickening, nodular changes in the pleura, septa, and the formation of the quality of effusion can be made. Exual exudates, whereas transudates are always anechoic. Pleural metastases are characteristically hypoechoic and nodular-polypoid. Pleural mesotheliomas can be delineated nearly equally well on sonograms and on computed tomography. Morphological and, in particular, functional diagnosis of the diaphragm by means of sonography is both reliable and convincing.

Endothelins (EDNs) participate in various physiological events including smooth muscle contraction, nitric oxide (NO) synthesis, and embryonic development. In this study, we investigated the regional roles of EDNs produced by bovine oviductal epithelial cells in NO synthesis and smooth muscle motility. Quantification of mRNA expressions indicated that expression of EDN receptor B (EDNRB) in the ampullary region was higher after ovulation than before ovulation, whereas expression of EDNRA in the isthmic region was higher after ovulation than before ovulation. Immunohistochemistry revealed that the EDN receptors (EDNRA and EDNRB) were expressed in the epithelium, whereas smooth muscle showed positive staining only for EDNRA. The expressionsPlease suggest whether 'NOS2' can be treated as the updated symbol for 'iNOS' as per gene nomenclature. of inducible NO synthase (iNOS) protein and its mRNA (NOS2) in cultured epithelial cells isolated from the ampulla were stimulated by EDN1, but not by EDN2 or EDN3, after 1h of incubation. In isthmic epithelial cells, none of the EDNs affected the expression of NOS2 Isometric contraction tests indicated that spontaneous waves were strong in the isthmic region but weak in the ampullary region. EDN1 modulated smooth muscle motility in both the regions. The overall findings suggest that EDN1 plays region-specific roles in smooth muscle motility and epithelial NO synthesis, providing an optimal oviductal microenvironment for transport of gametes, fertilization, and development/transport of early embryo.

31508489v1 NPJ breast cancer 5:29,2019 "Success rates of re-excision after positive margins for invasive lobular carcinoma of the breast." Rates of positive margins after surgical resection of invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC) are high (ranging from 18 to 60%), yet the efficacy of re-excision lumpReceptor subtypeectomy for clearing positive margins is unknown. Concerns about the diffuse nature of ILC may drive increased rates of completion mastectomy to treat positive margins, thus lowering breast conservation rates. We therefore determined the success rate of re-excision lumpectomy in women with ILC and positive margins after surgical resection. We identified 314 cases of stage I-III ILC treated with breast conserving surgery (BCS) at the University of California, San Francisco. Surgical procedures, pathology reports, and outcomes were analyzed using univariate and multivariate statistics and Cox-proportional hazards models. We evaluated outcomes before and after the year 2014, when new margin management consensus guidelines were published. Positive initial margins occurred in 118 (37.6%) cases. Of these, 62 (52.5%) underwent re-excision lumpectomy, which cleared the margin in 74.2%. On multivariate analysis, node negativity was significantly associated with successful re-excision (odds ratio [OR] 3.99, 95% CI 1.15-13.81, <i>p</i>\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x890.029). After 2014, we saw fewer initial positive margins (42.7% versus 25.5%, <i>p</i>\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x890.009), second surgeries (54.6% versus 20.2%, <i>p</i>\xe2\x80\x89&lt;\xe2\x80\x890.001), and completion mastectomies (27.7% versus 4.5%, <i>p</i>\xe2\x80\x89&lt;\xe2\x80\x890.001). In this large cohort of women with ILC, re-excision lumpectomy was highly successful at clearing positive margins. Additionally, positive margins and completion mastectomy rates significantly decreased over time. These findings highlight improvements in management of ILC, and suggest that completion mastectomy may not be required for those with positive margins after initial BCS.

The treatment of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) in elderly patients continues to be a challenge because of the characteS.G.B.ristics of this population and the lack of data and specific recommendations. This review summarizes the current evidence about critical points of oral antithrombotic therapy in elderly patients. To this end, we discuss the peculiarities and differences reported referring to dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) in ACS management in elderly patients and what might be the best option considering these population characteristics. Furthermore, we analyze antithrombotic strategies in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF), with a particular focus on those cases that also present coronary artery disease (CAD). It is imperative to deepen our knowledge regarding the management of these challenging patients through real-world data and specifically designed geriatric studies to help resolve the questions remaining in their disease management.

THE PATIENTas cystometry and integrated sphincter electromyography. The patient had no clinical signs of neurological disease. Six had neurogenic exaggeration of the detrusor reflex in the preoperative studies. In 3 patients changes in the detrusor reflex were found postoperatively. Postural changes in detrusor reflex excitability were encountered preoperatively and postoperatively. The preoperative finding of detrusor hyperreflexia in the majority of the patients is ascribed to lesions in the detrusor reflex organization at 2 anatomical sites: 1) a subclinical lesion of the cerebral circuits of the detrusor reflex control owing to arteriosclerosis and 2) an increase of sensory detrusor-reflex triggering stimuli from the morphologically changed prostatic urethra. The study calls for diagnostic techniques for delineation of minimal cerebrospinal impairment and objective assessment of the sensory innervation of the urethra.

The aim of this study was to explore the way in which reports of strategic and tactical driving self-regulation are influenced by readiness to change driving behaviour in older men and women, either reporting or not reporting modification of driving behaviour for health-related reasons, and/or increased driving difficulty. Current Australian drivers aged over 60 years (N\xe2\x80\xaf=\xe2\x80\xaf258) responded to a self-report questionnaire. Hierarchical regression analyses indicated increased use of tactical behaviours were associated with greater driving difficulty, more readiness to change and male gender (R<sup>2</sup>\xe2\x80\xaf=\xe2\x80\xaf23.2%) . These effects were moderated by a significant association between readiness to change, driving modifications for health reasons and age (R<sup>2</sup><sub>chg</sub>\xe2\x80\xaf=\xe2\x80\xaf2.9%). Greater readiness to change was associated with increased use of tactical behaviours for older drivers who did not modify driving for health reasons, independent of ageIndependent of age. This association was also found for younger old drivers with health difficulties, but not for older old drivers with health difficulties. Hierarchical regression indicated that greater readiness to change, increased driving difficulty, female gender and modification of driving for health reasons were associated with reports of increased strategic self-regulation (R<sup>2</sup>\xe2\x80\xaf=\xe2\x80\xaf50.8%). These effects were moderated by readiness to change and age, and readiness to change and gender (R<sup>2</sup><sub>chg</sub>\xe2\x80\xaf=\xe2\x80\xaf2.1%). The association between readiness to change and strategic self-regulation was stronger for women than men, and the strength of this association became substantially stronger with increasing age. It was concluded that readiness to change driving behaviour may promote different forms of driving self-regulation for different individuals, and that older drivers may use the different forms of driving self-regulation independently of one another.

Seasonal influenza has a significant annual global impact. Current influenza vaccines work by inducing strain-specific antibodies against the highly polymorphic surface proteins of the influenza virus and need to be redesigned every year, increasing their cost and limiting availability. There is a demand for a more efficacious vaccine, particularly in older adults in which the current vaccines show poor efficacy. The aim is to investigate a novel vaccine, MVA-NP+M1, which targets T cell responses to the nucleoprotein and matrix 1 core proteins of the influenza virus A, which are highly conserved, <b>\xc2\xa0</b>and therefore may provide long protection against a broad range of influenza strains.

Water resources of our earth is currently facing a serious challenge due to human activities including industrial development, agricultural revolution, urban growth and deforestation. The first step for pollutant removal is obviously their detection in water which requires use of various well known instrumentation techniques or use of sensors. Of all the different types of sensors, gold and silver nanoparticle based colorimetric/plasmonic nano-sensors are particularly noteworthy because of their simplicity and low cost. These nano-sensors are based on principle of SPR, an optical phenomenon immensely dependent on characteristics of the nanoparticles. Noble metal nanoparticles are widely chosen for colorimetric sensing application as their SPR absorbance lie in the visible region of spectrum rendering unique colors to them. Also, they are easy to synthesize, easy to functionalize, biocompatible and stable. In this detection technique, the presence of a pollutant is revealed by a distinct, visual color change and can also be quantified using a UV-Visible Spectrophotometer. Sustainable chemistry being one of the focal points of modern chemistry research, green synthesis of nanoparticles, particularly noble metal nanoparticles such as gold and silver have attracted considerable attention in last decade. Although gold and silver nanoparticles based optical sensor have been summarized in various reviews over last few years, colorimetric nano-sensors synthesized by green methods have found little discussion in scientific literature. This critical review aims to connect this gap by portraying this sparsely explored area of application of biosynthesized silver and gold nanoparticles and thus will assist the researchers working in this field.

Inflammation plays a pivotal role in all stages of atherosclerosis and therefore targeting the key enzymes of this pathway may help in ameliorating the disease progression. The current study is aimed to identify small lead molecules as a promising inhibitor for the cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), a therapeutically important protein involved in the prostaglandin biosynthesis pathway and a key player in driving the inflammatory atherogenic progression. Herein, we have used extensive computational methods such as virtual screening, protein-ligand docking, molecular dynamics simulation and binding free energy analysis. Out of 2500 molecules, 1408 compounds have favourable drug-like properties. ZINC72348892 showed GOLD fitness score of 86.38 with COX-2 and established two hydrogen bonds with Phe519 and mostly hydrophobic interactions. The second lead ZINC72295579 showed GOLD fitness score of 84.07 with COX-2 and exhibited four hydrogen bonds with His90, Tyr356, Tyr386 and Ala528. Both the lead compounds exhibit high binding affinity for COX-2 compared with COX-1 isoenzyme. Further, the lead molecules showed a favourable Molecular mechanics Poisson-Boltzmann surface area (MM/PBSA) Gibbs binding free energy lower compared to the control. Van der Waal energy is the predominant component driving the interaction of the lead molecules with COX-2. Essential dynamics and entropy calculation further confirmed the structural rigidity and compactness of the protein upon binding of the lead molecules. Thus our findings suggest that ZINC72348892 and ZINC72295579 as promising lead molecules for inhibition of COX-2 and which would provide alternative chemotypes in the drug discovery pipeline for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases.AbbreviationsCVDsCardiovascular diseasesCOXCyclooxygenaseMDMolecular dynamicsMM/PBSAMolecular mechanics Poisson-Boltzmann surface areaROFRule of fiveNVTNumber of particles, volume and temperatureNPTNumber of particles, pressure and temperatureRMSDRoot mean square deviationRMSFRoot mean square fluctuationSASASolvent accessible surface areaRgRadius of gyrationPCAPrincipal component analysisEDEssential dynamicsNHBsNumber of hydrogen bondsCommunicated by Ramaswamy H.

Drug discovery for a vigorous and feasible lead candidate is a challenging scientific mission as it requires expertise, experience, and huge investment. Natural products and their derivatives having structural diversity are renowned source of therapeutic agents since many years. Tyrosol (a natural phenylethanoid) has been extracted from olive oil, and its structure was confirmed by elemental analysis, FT-IR, FT-NMR, and single crystal X-ray crystallography. The conformational analysis for tyrosol geometry was performed by Gaussian 09 in terms of density functional theory. Validation of bond lengths and bond angles obtained experimentally as well as theoretically were performed with the help of curve fitting analysis, and values of correlation coefficient (<i>R</i>) obtained as 0.988 and 0.984, respectively. The charge transfer within the tyrosol molecule was confirmed by analysis of HOMO\xe2\x86\x92LUMO molecular orbitals. In molecular docking with COX-2 (PDB ID: 5F1A), tyrosol was found to possess satisfactory binding affinity as compared to other NSAIDs (Aspirin, Ibuprofen, and Naproxen) and a COX-2 selective drug (Celecoxib). ADMET prediction, drug-likeness and bioactivity score altogether confirm the lead/drug like potential of tyrosol.

Cytokinin oxidase/dehydrogenase (CKX) is the only known enzyme associated with irreversible degradation of cytokinins in plants. CKX2 contains flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) domain. Earlier studies utilising antisense &amp; hpRNAi suppression techniques in mutant/transgenic rice plants revealed that when CKX2 binds with FAD, CKX2 expression reduces, which in turn causes cytokinin aggregation in inflorescence meristem that subsequently enhances both branches and grain number resulting in increased grain yield. Owing to the non-existence of complete three-dimensional structure of CKX2, insight into the structure and function of CKX2 and its relationship with its cofactor FAD is still a topic of debate. In the present study, computational approach was employed to estimate the three-dimensional structure of CKX2 through comparative modelling approach. Later, CKX2 and FAD interaction study was performed to understand the underlying mechanism involved with reduced expression of CKX2. Molecular dynamic simulation studies of both CKX2 and CKX-FAD complex revealed that after binding with FAD, CKX2 experienced increased pressure and reduced RMSD, potential energy and free energy landscape energy, which in turn lessen anti-correlation between almost all \xce\xb1 and \xce\xb2 strands and random motion of C-\xce\xb1, subsequently reducing CKX2 expression. In near future, these information can be utilised for increasing rice yield under irrigated field condition by introgression of <i>Gn1a</i> gene through marker assisted back-crossing breeding.

He had bilateral parieto-occipital cephalohaematomata, scattered petechiae and intermittent hypotonia. He was otherwise neurologically normal. A septic screen was completed and antibiotics and aciclovir were given. Cranial ultrasound, cerebral function monitoring and electroencephalography were normal. An echocardiogram demonstrated normal function and intracardiac anatomy but was suspicious for a dysplastic aortic arch and anomalous left pulmonary artery-aorta connection thus he was transferred to the regional paediatric cardiology centre where cardiac CT (figure 1) was undertaken. CT brain (figure 2) was performed simultaneously to delineate the cerebral vascular anatomy but demonstrated an intracranial lesion that accounted for the baby's presentation. edpract;106/4/233/BLKF1F1BLK_F1Figure 13D reconstruction of cardiac CT demonstrates, from this posterior perspective, the course and calibre of the major systemic and pulmonary arteries and venous return. edpract;106/4/233/BLKF2F2BLK_F2Figure 2CT brain was undertaken at the time of cardiac CT to establish the cerebral arterial vascular anatomy.

The human IgG3 subclass is conspicuously absent among the formats for approved monoclonal antibody therapies and Fc fusion protein biologics. Concern about the potential for rapid degradation, reduced plasma half-life, and increased immunogenicity due to marked variation in allotypes has apparently outweighed the potential advantages of IgG3, which include high affinity for activating Fc<b>\xce\xb3</b> receptors, effective complement fixation, and a long hinge that appears better suited for low abundance targets. This review aims to highlight distinguishing features of IgG3 and to explore its functional role in the immune response. We present studies of natural immunity and recombinant antibody therapies that elucidate key contributions of IgG3 and discuss historical roadblocks that no longer remain clearly relevant. Collectively, this body of evidence motivates thoughtful reconsideration of the clinical advancement of this distinctive antibody subclass for treatment of human diseases. <b>Abbreviations:</b> ADCC - Antibody-Dependent Cell-mediated CytotoxicityADE - Antibody-dependent enhancementAID - Activation-Induced Cytidine DeaminaseCH - Constant HeavyCHF - Complement factor HCSR - Class Switch RecombinationEM - Electron MicroscopyFab - Fragment, antigen bindingFc - Fragment, crystallizableFcRn - Neonatal Fc ReceptorFc\xce\xb3R - Fc gamma ReceptorHIV - Human Immunodeficiency VirusIg - ImmunoglobulinIgH - Immunoglobulin Heavy chain geneNHP - Non-Human Primate.

11540548v1 Uchu Seibutsu Kagaku 11(2):87-111,1997 "[Squirrel monkey--an ideal primate (correction of prmate) model of space physiology]." Investigation of the vestibulo-ocular system of the squirrel monkey was reviewed in consideration of space motion sickness (SMS), or which is recently more often termed as space adaptation syndrome (SAS). Since the first launching of the space satellite, Sputnik [correction of Sputonik] in October 1957, many experiments were carried out in biological and medical fields. A various kind of creatures were used as experimental models from protozoa to human beings. Rats and monkeys are most favorite animals, particularly the non-human primate seems to be the one, because of its phylogenetic relatives akin to the human beings. Chimpanzees, rhesus monkeys, pig tailed-monkeys, red-faced monkeys and squirrel monkeys have been used mostly in American space experiments. Russian used rhesus monkeys. Among these, however, the squirrel monkey has an advantage of the small size of the body, ranging from 600- l000g in adult. This small size as a primate is very advantageous in experiments conducted in a narrow room of the space satellite or shuttle because of its space-saving. The squirrel monkey has another advantage to rear easily as is demonstrated to keep it as a pet. Accordingly, this petit animal provides us a good animal model in biological and medical experiments in space craft. The size of the brain of the squirrel monkey is extraordinary large relative to the body size, which is even superior to that of the human beings. This is partly owed to enlargement of the occipito-temporal cortices, which are forced to well develop for processing a huge amount of audio-visual information indispensable to the arboreal habitant to survive in tropical forest. The vestibular system of the squirrel monkey seems to be the most superior as well, when judged from it relative size of the vestibular nuclear complex. Balancing on swinging twigs or jumping from tree to tree developed the capability of this equilibrium system. Fernandez, Goldberg and his collaborators used the squirrel monkey to elucidate functions of the peripheral vestibular system. A transfer function was proposed to explain the behaviors of regular and irregular unit activity of vestibular nerve fibers. The physiologic characteristics of the second order vestibular neuron was investigated in combination of electrophysiological and micro-morphological way, with using WGA-HRP methods, in relation to somato-motor and eye movements. Interconnections between vestibular neurons and cerebellum, interstitial nucleus of Cajal, oculomotor nuclear complex, superior colliculus and cervical spinal cord were elucidated. In physiological field of the vestibular system, the vestibulo-ocular reflex is well studied and results obtained from the squirrel monkey experiments were reviewed. The squirrel monkey, particularly the Bolivian, is a unique animal in that it is vulnerable to motion sickness induced by visual-motion stimulation with phase mismatch of the two stimuli. Experimental results of labyrinthectomy or bilateral ablation of the maculae staticae led to the conclusion that both semicircular and otolith organs are involved in the genesis of space motion sickness. On the other hand, destruction of the area postrema, acknowledged as the vomiting center to chemical stimulants, produced controversial results. However, it must be pointed out that the a human subject underwent to resection of the area postrema, became insensitive to administration of apomorphine, a well known chemical stimulant of vomiting. Finally the experiments in space revealed the presence of at least two origins of caloric nystagmus, that is, attributable to convection and non-convection current of the endolymphatic fluid.
11858270v1 Acta astronautica 48(5-12):287-97 "Aquatic modules for bioregenerative life support systems based on the C.E.B.A.S. biotechnology [correction of biotechnilogy]." Most concepts for bioregenerative life support systems are based on edible higher land plants which create some problems with growth and seed generation under space conditions. Animal protein production is mostly neglected because of the tremendous waste management problems with tetrapods under reduced weightlessness. Therefore, the "Closed Equilibrated Biological Aquatic System" (C.E.B.A.S.) was developed which represents an artificial aquatic ecosystem containing aquatic organisms which are adapted at all to "near weightlessness conditions" (fishes Xiphophorus helleri, water snails Biomphalaria glabrata, ammonia oxidizing bacteria and the rootless non-gravitropic edible water plant Ceratophyllum demersum). Basically the C.E.B.A.S. consists of 4 subsystems: a ZOOLOGICAL (correction of ZOOLOGICASL) COMPONENT
